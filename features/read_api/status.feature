    Scenario: checking an in-date data_set
        Given I have a data_set named "recent" with settings
            | key              | value |
            | max_age_expected | 60    |
        and I have a record updated "10 seconds" ago in the "recent" data_set
        when I go to "/_status/data-sets"
        then I should get back a status of "200"
        and I should get back the status of "ok"

    Scenario: checking an out-of-date data_set
        Given I have a data_set named "recent" with settings

            | max_age_expected | 1     |
        and I have a record updated "10 seconds" ago in the "recent" data_set
        when I go to "/_status/data-sets"
        then I should get back a status of "200"
         and I should get back the status of "not okay"
